# WTS API Acceptance Tests

This repository contains all the Ruby automated acceptance tests

# Notes

- The gems used for the acceptance tests are contained within the `Gemfile`
- A number of generic UI steps have been included in `features/step-defintions/generic_ui_steps` to help get you started

The test run results will be shown in `report.json` as usual.
