# About digital waste tracking
The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) intend to transform how data about waste movements is collected and shared with the regulators across all 4 UK nations. Rollout of a new digital service is planned from April 2026.

You can read more about the [digital waste tracking policy on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-waste-tracking-service/mandatory-digital-waste-tracking).

## Submitting data about waste movements: planned changes
We are exploring the development of new APIs to integrate with waste management software and other systems. By having waste carriers and receiversÂ submit data via APIs, we can give regulators a more joined-up and comprehensive picture of all waste movements.

This site will contain draft details for the technical design of the service, including a list of data definitions, and a link to the draft API specification.

## How we are engaging with the waste industry
We want to test the feasibility of an API-driven service as early as we can, including learning about any barriers to delivering it. We welcome feedback from people in the waste industry to help us do this.

We are currently talking to the following groups of people to help us learn about any barriers to us delivering this new service:

* waste carriers
* waste receivers
* waste management software suppliers

### How to get involved
We are planning further user research and other opportunities for people in the waste industry to give feedback and test the solutions we're looking to develop.
