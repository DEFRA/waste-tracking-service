# About Digital Waste Tracking

The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) are working with waste regulators to deliver a digital service for tracking waste movements across all 4 UK nations. Rollout of a new digital service is planned from April 2026. You can read more about the [digital waste tracking policy on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-waste-tracking-service/mandatory-digital-waste-tracking).

## New draft Defra APIs
We are exploring the development of new APIs to integrate with waste management software and other systems. By moving to a new process where waste carriers and receiversÂ submit data via APIs, we think we can give regulators a more joined-up picture of waste movements.

This site will contain draft details for the technical design of the service, including a list of data definitions, and a link to the draft API specification.

## How we are engaging with the waste industry
We want to get feedback from those working in the waste industry to help us test the feasibility of an API-driven service as early as we can.

We are currently talking to the following groups of people to help us learn about any barriers to us delivering this new service:

* waste carriers
* waste receivers
* waste management software suppliers

### How you can get involved
We are planning further user research and other opportunities for the above groups to feedback on our designs as they develop. More details about how to get involved will be published here.
