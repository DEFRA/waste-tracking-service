# Initial scope - receivers only by October 2026

The waste industry involves a large number and complex array of operators. This includes approximately:

- 12,000 waste site operators
- 150,000 registered waste exemption holders 
- 300,000 registered waste carriers, brokers and dealers

These work across the UK in a wide variety of sectors with varying levels of digital capability.  

To build a stable, effective and user-friendly service we need to build it incrementally. This starts with the creation of a firm foundation which delivers some of the intended benefits. Additional aspects can be added as we learn from testing the core elements of the service. This will allow us to refine and adjust our approach as we move towards a more complete end-to-end waste tracking service.  

Following assessment of the options and international best practice, the first element of our waste tracking service will focus on waste receiving sites inputting data about all waste they receive. This includes waste containing persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Following this phase, we are planning to expand the service to other waste operators.

## What do we mean by waste receiving sites?

Those required to hold a permit or licence to receive waste will be mandated to record details of waste received on the digital waste tracking service from October 2026.  

We recognise that waste can also be received under other types of authorisations, such as registered exemptions. But the numbers of operators of these are much larger and more diverse in terms of scale and types of operation.

We will consider over the next few months whether there are any specific sectors or categories of operation within this group. It would be prudent to mandate use of the service alongside permit and licence holders. We will confirm by September 2025, if this is the case.

## Household Waste Recycling Centres (HWRCs)

As previously announced Household Waste Recycling Centre operators will not need to record household waste received in the waste tracking service.

We will engage with local authorities regarding the feasibility of recording commercial waste accepted at these sites during the initial phase.
