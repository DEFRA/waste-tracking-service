# API Testing and Examples

Bruno has been selected as our preferred API testing and documentation tool, following [GOV.UK API technical and data standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards#test-your-assumptions-with-users) for providing test services and living documentation.

## What is Bruno?

Bruno is a software tool that helps developers test and interact with our waste tracking APIs. Think of it as a specialised testing environment where developers can try out different API features, check that everything works correctly, and share their testing setup with their team. It's designed to work across different stages of development, from initial testing to production use.
