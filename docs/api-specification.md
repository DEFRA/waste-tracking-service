# Receipt of Waste - draft API specification

<b>Private Beta</b>

Are you a waste receiver or software provider and want to get involved? [Sign up for our Digital Waste Tracking Private Beta test](private-beta-comms-sign-up.md)

These APIs are in Private Beta stage. They may be updated to reflect changes to policy, legislation and user feedback.

We are designing waste tracking APIs to be flexible and accommodate differences in business processes, allowing for:

- separate submission of waste collection and receipt data, whilst maintaining a connection between the two
- differences in data requirements
- data to be submitted in any order (e.g. receipt before collection)

## Open API specification
The following Private Beta specification is published on the Swagger API hub:
