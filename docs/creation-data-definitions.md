# Creation data - when a waste movement is created (work in progress)
These draft data definition tables describe the information we expect to be recorded by the future waste tracking service when a waste movement is created.

They are a work in progress and may be updated to reflect changes to policy, legislation and feedback received from those in the waste industry.
