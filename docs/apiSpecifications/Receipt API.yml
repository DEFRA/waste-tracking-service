  title: Digital Waste Tracking Receipt API
  version: "1.0"
  description: |
    <p>This API is for waste receivers, software developers and third party software users. It enables operators of permitted or licensed waste receiving sites to report details of each waste movement arriving at their site. This will be mandatory from October 2026. More information about Digital Waste Tracking 
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-waste-tracking-service/digital-waste-tracking-service.">is available here:</a>
     <p><h2>Methods</h2></p>
     <p>The API is based on REST principles and uses seven endpoints: <font color="green"><b>POST</b></font>, <font color="orange"><b>PUT</b></font> and five <font color="blue"><b>GET</b></font> methods that return data in JSON format. It uses standard HTTP error response codes.</p>
     <ul>
     <li><p>The API <font color="green"><b>POST</b></font> method is used to create a record for a waste movement that has arrived at a waste receiving site. It returns a waste tracking ID and a validation result.</p></li>
     <li><p>The API <font color="orange"><b>PUT</b></font> method is used to update a waste tracking record using a waste tracking ID to identify the movement. It returns a validation result.</p></li>
     <li><p>The first <font color="blue"><b>GET</b></font> method is used to retrieve a list of European Waste Codes (EWC).</p></li>
     <li><p>The second <font color="blue"><b>GET</b></font> method is used to retrieve a list of Hazardous Property Codes (called Special Waste Codes in Scotland).</p></li>
     <li><p>The third <font color="blue"><b>GET</b></font> method is used to retrieve a list of Disposal or Recovery codes.</p></li>
     <li><p>The fourth <font color="blue"><b>GET</b></font> method is used to retrieve a list of Container Types.</p></li>
     <li><p>The fifth <font color="blue"><b>GET</b></font> method is used to retrieve a list of POP (Persistent Organic Pollutant) name codes.</p></li>
     </ul>
     <b>Note-</b> This API specification is currently in Private Beta stage.

            ```
            The response fields: "isHazardous", "entryTypeDescription", "chapter" and "subChapter" correspond directly to the hierarchical structure of the waste classification system for EWC codes.<br><br>
            <p><b>isHazardous</b><br>
            This boolean field indicates whether the waste code is classified as hazardous waste (true) or non-hazardous waste (false). This classification is crucial for regulatory compliance and handling procedures.<br><br>
            <b>entryTypeDesc</b><br>
            This describes the type of entry for the waste code. It indicates whether the entry is:<br>
            - Absolute hazardous (always hazardous, marked with *)<br>
            - Absolute non-hazardous (never hazardous)<br>
            - Mirror entry (hazardous or non-hazardous depending on composition).This classification is important for determining if additional assessment is needed.<br><br>
            <p><b>chapter</b><br>
            Refers to the first two digits of the six-digit List of Waste (LoW) code. It defines the main category of waste, usually based on the industry or process generating the waste.<br><br>
            Example:<br><br>
            01 – Wastes from mining and physical/chemical treatment of minerals<br>
            10 – Wastes from thermal processes<br><br>
            </p>
            <p><b>subChapter</b><br>
            Corresponds to the third and fourth digits of the LoW code. It narrows down the category to a more specific process or material within the chapter.<br><br>
            Example:<br><br>
            10 02 – Wastes from the iron and steel industry<br><br>

These codes (Recovery (R) and Disposal (D)) serve as a standardised system to ensure proper handling and treatment of waste materials. Specifically, they aid in classifying whether waste is to be recovered for further use or disposed of in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.
