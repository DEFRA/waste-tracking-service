  title: Digital Waste Tracking Receipt API
  version: "1.0"
  description: |
    <p>This API is for waste receivers, software developers and third party software users. It enables operators of permitted or licenced waste receiving sites to report details of each waste movement arriving at their site. This will be mandatory from October 2026. More information about Digital Waste Tracking is available here:
    <p><a>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-waste-tracking-service/digital-waste-tracking-service.</a></p>
     <p><h2>Methods</h2></p> <p>The API is based on REST principles and uses both a <font color="green"><b>POST</b></font> and a <font color="orange"><b>PUT</b></font> method that return data in JSON format. It uses standard HTTP error response codes. </p>
     <p>The API <font color="green"><b>POST</b></font> method is used to create a record for a waste movement that has arrived at a waste receiving site. It returns a waste tracking ID and a validation result. </p> <p>The API <font color="orange"><b>PUT</b></font> method is used to update a waste tracking record using a waste tracking ID to identify the movement. It returns a validation result.</p>
     <p> <b>Note-</b> This API specification is currently in draft stage and is subject to change.</p>

                  UTC is the global time standard and does not observe daylight saving time.
                  BST is UTC+1, used in the UK during daylight saving time (typically from late March to late October).

             Disposal and Recovery Codes play a crucial role in categorising the methods by which waste is managed, whether through recovery or disposal processes. These codes serve as a standardised system to ensure proper handling and treatment of waste materials. Specifically, they aid in classifying whether waste is to be recovered for further use or disposed of in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.
