# Receipt of Waste API - Roadmap

## Recently released

Updated API specification

We have published a revised API specification based on the feedback we gathered from waste operators, regulators and software developers during Alpha.

## What we’re working on at the moment

### Expanding our documentation
We will publish additional documentation such as details of the business rules and validation that apply to the API.

### Enabling developers to test their integration with the API
By the end of August we will publish an initial set of test scenarios. We are also working to provide a test environment for the Receipt of Waste API in early September.
### Validation and authentication
We are completing the development of the API so that the behaviour is aligned with the API specification and business rules.

## What’s next

### Process for going into production
We will provide more detail on the steps developers will need to go through in order to have your integration with Receipt of Waste service approved.

### Onboarding first Waste Receivers to private beta
We will invite Waste Receivers to onboard to private beta once their software provider/internal development team has integrated with Receipt of Waste. We will start with a small cohort of Waste Receivers and then gradually invite more into the service.
As part of of onboarding Waste Receivers will need to provide some details to their software provider or internal development team so that the software can be configured to report waste movement data for their receiving sites.

### Enabling people who don’t have waste software to report waste movements

We are aware that not all Waste Receivers have software that can report data directly to the Receipt of Waste API. Therefore we are developing an alternative option for Waste Receivers without  suitable software.
