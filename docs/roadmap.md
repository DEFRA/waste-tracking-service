# Receipt of Waste API - Roadmap

## Recently released

### Updated API specification
We have published a [revised API specification](https://defra.github.io/waste-tracking-service/api-specification/) based on the feedback we gathered from waste operators, regulators and software developers during Alpha.

### Enabling developers to test their integration with the API
We have provided a [test environment and set of test scenarios](https://defra.github.io/waste-tracking-service/api-testing-and-examples/) for the Receipt of Waste API.

### Credentials for test environment issued
We have emailed client IDs and secrets to all developer participants in the private beta. Refer [authentication guide](https://defra.github.io/waste-tracking-service/api-authentication-guide/) for information on how to authenticate with the test environment.


## Whatâ€™s next

### Process for going into production
We will provide more detail on the steps developers will need to go through in order to have your integration with Receipt of Waste service approved.

### Onboarding first Waste Receivers to private beta
We will invite Waste Receivers to onboard to private beta once their software provider/internal development team has integrated with Receipt of Waste. We will start with a small cohort of Waste Receivers and then gradually invite more into the service.
As part of of onboarding Waste Receivers will need to provide some details to their software provider or internal development team so that the software can be configured to report waste movement data for their receiving sites.
