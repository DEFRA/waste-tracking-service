# Apply to voluntarily test the service for reporting waste received (Private beta)

## About the private beta

A private beta is a way of testing a service or product with a select group of chosen users to gather feedback and iron out any issues during the development  

Our aims are to:

* help software developers and waste receivers prepare for the mandatory changes to the reporting of waste movements (coming into effect from October 2026\)  
* give software developers (including third-party and internal development teams) as much time as possible to integrate their products and systems with the [Defra Receipt of Waste API](https://defra.github.io/waste-tracking-service/api-specification/)   
* test that our APIs, processes and documentation meet the needs of waste receivers and software developers  
* ensure the data we collect meets the needs of waste regulators  
* test and refine our registration, onboarding and support processes

## Who can take part in the private beta

To be eligible to take part, your organisation must:

* operate one or more licensed or permitted waste receiving sites in the UK  
* be able to work with your external software developers or internal development team so you can provide data about the waste you receive via the [Receipt of Waste API](https://defra.github.io/waste-tracking-service/api-specification/)  
* agree for data provided during private beta to be reviewed by regulators and policy analysts for testing purposes  
* be willing to provide regular feedback on your experiences of using the service, including through surveys, user research sessions, diary studies etc.

## When will the private beta start

Organisations that have applied to take part will start to be invited to join the private beta from Autumn 2025\. We will send out invites gradually as we test and learn from running the service.

From Spring 2026 we plan to allow all waste receivers to voluntarily use the public beta service.

**Note:** it will become mandatory for all waste receivers to use the service from October 2026\.

## How to apply to join the private beta

To be invited to take part in the private beta, you must first register an interest to use the service.

**Note:** We will invite a range of waste receivers, and software developers of varying size, sectors and UK nations. For this reason we may not be able to invite all organisations who have applied to take part in the private beta.

You will need to:

* give basic details about your organisation, including contact details, type of waste and size of your organisation  
* give details of any waste management software you currently use

## How to prepare for waste tracking if youâ€™re unable to take part

We have published [documentation about waste tracking on GitHub](https://defra.github.io/waste-tracking-service/) which we will continue to update regularly. 

We will continue to do user research with people in the waste industry at the same time as running the private beta service. To register an interest, [sign up for the waste tracking user panel](https://defragroup.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9QqfQNqEnI7ecDQ).

We are also holding regular webinars and engagement events. [Sign up to the circular economy newsletter](https://confirmsubscription.com/h/t/EBFF97EEADC3DECE) to get updates about these.
